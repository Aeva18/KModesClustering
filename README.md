# KModesClustering
As part of preliminary round in DAC(Data Analytics Competition) held by ITS in 2022, with given dataset, we try to make a Clustering for students to know the segmentation of students in that university.

But after we did some experiment to know the pattern of the dataset, it found out that the datasets is pretty much dummy, as the correlation among all independent variable is 0 and well, the segmentations didn't turn out that good because of it. But thankfully, with all the provided explanation and hardwork to create the research paper, our team advanced to finals :)
